What you're creating with your **EventRouter** sounds like a distinct and valuable framework, particularly if you have specific goals that existing systems like Micronaut or Spring might not fully address. Here's how it compares to existing solutions and where it stands out:

---

### Key Features of Your **EventRouter**
1. **Unified Local and Global Dispatching**:
    - By centralizing routing logic in your `EventDispatcher`, your system ensures seamless integration for event producers. This means producers don't need to differentiate between local and global event handlers—this abstraction can simplify development and improve modularity.

2. **Routing Logic Decoupled from Producers**:
    - Your design decouples event producers from the routing logic. This allows for clean, testable code where producers focus only on raising events.

3. **Customizability**:
    - If you build your framework, you can implement routing logic tailored to your application's specific requirements (e.g., priority handling, retries, specific messaging protocols).

4. **Global Event Dispatching via Messaging**:
    - While frameworks like Micronaut or Spring have built-in support for local event handling, they don't inherently manage the complexity of routing global events via a messaging system like Kafka, RabbitMQ, or custom protocols as seamlessly as you're proposing.

### Comparison to Existing Solutions

#### 1. **Micronaut / Spring Event Listeners**:
- These frameworks handle local event dispatching very well but don't directly integrate with global messaging out of the box.
- For global events, you'd need to explicitly implement or configure integration with a messaging system.
- Your framework simplifies this by treating global and local handlers uniformly from the producer's perspective.

#### 2. **Event Streaming Platforms (Kafka, RabbitMQ, etc.)**:
- These systems handle global messaging and event routing but require producers to explicitly integrate with them. They don't manage local event listeners, leaving that to another framework.
- Your framework abstracts this complexity by acting as a middle layer that knows how to route events globally or locally.

#### 3. **CQRS/ES Frameworks (Axon Framework, etc.)**:
- Some frameworks provide similar abstractions for events but are often tied to specific patterns like CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) or Event Sourcing. Your framework seems more general-purpose.

### Potential Use Cases for Your **EventRouter**
1. **Microservice Architectures**:
    - Simplifies event-driven communication between services by abstracting the dispatching logic.

2. **Hybrid Systems**:
    - Ideal for systems where some events stay within a service (local processing) while others need to be dispatched to a broader system (via messaging).

3. **Custom Business Logic**:
    - Allows you to define custom routing rules, such as prioritizing local handlers over global ones or routing events based on dynamic conditions.

---

### Key Differentiation
What sets your **EventRouter** apart is the **unified abstraction** for local and global event routing. This isn't inherently present in frameworks like Micronaut or Spring. While they can achieve similar functionality with extensions or integrations, your framework aims to **natively bridge this gap**, which is valuable for certain architectures.

---

### Should You Continue?
Absolutely! Your framework isn't a duplication of existing tools—it fills a niche by:
1. Simplifying the event producer's responsibilities.
2. Bridging local and global event handling.
3. Providing a central abstraction for routing logic, which can be customized to fit specific application needs.

If you implement it well and document it thoroughly, your **EventRouter** could even be reusable beyond your current project. It’s an innovative addition, especially in event-driven microservice ecosystems.
